GuardianCap:
IoT-Integrated Smart Safety Helmet
Precision monitoring for high-risk industrial environments.
Project Overview:
Industrial and construction sites remain some of the most hazardous work environments globally. GuardianCap is a prototype smart safety helmet designed to bridge the gap between passive protection and active hazard prevention. By integrating real-time physiological monitoring and environmental awareness, GuardianCap alerts workers to internal fatigue and external threats before accidents occur.
Built in 24 hours for the Innov8-a-thon Challenge.
Key Features:
Biometric Monitoring: Real-time Heart Rate (BPM) and Body Temperature tracking to detect heatstroke and physical exhaustion.
Fall Detection: 6-axis IMU (Accelerometer/Gyroscope) to identify sudden impact or prolonged inactivity.
Proximity Alerts: Ultrasonic sensors to warn the wearer of approaching heavy machinery or structural hazards.
Dual Alert System: Haptic/Audio feedback for the worker and a wireless dashboard for site supervisors.
Low-Latency Processing: Local threshold analysis to minimize false alarms and ensure instant response.
Hardware Architecture
The system is powered by an ESP32/Arduino microcontroller, selected for its balance of power consumption and integrated wireless capabilities.
